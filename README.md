# Expo Camera API: Handling Uncommon Permission and Hardware Access Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario encountered when using Expo's `Camera` API. The error relates to issues with permissions or accessing the camera hardware. The app might crash or display a generic error message without specifying the precise reason.

## Problem

The primary challenge is that when `Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()` fails (due to permission denial or camera unavailability),  Expo doesn't always provide a detailed, user-friendly error message. This makes debugging difficult.

## Solution

The solution focuses on robust error handling.  This includes explicitly checking for permission status and using more informative error messaging for the user.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `expo install expo-camera`
3. Run the app on your device or simulator.
4. Observe the error handling mechanisms when camera permission is denied or the camera is unavailable.
